**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

Ensuring that code, programs, or software are both functional and secure involves implementing a comprehensive testing strategy. This includes conducting unit tests to verify individual components' functionality, integration tests to ensure different parts of the system work together seamlessly, and system tests to evaluate the software's behavior as a whole. Furthermore, ecurity testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, is essential to identify and mitigate potential security risks. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires effective communication and collaboration with stakeholders. This involves conducting user research, gathering requirements, and creating user stories to understand users' goals, preferences, and pain points. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

When approaching software design, it's crucial to consider both functional and non-functional requirements. This includes designing prototype intuitive user interfaces and optimizing system performance, scalability, and reliability. Applying design principles such as modularity, abstraction and polymorphism, can help create software that is maintainable, extensible and readable. By adopting industry-standard methologies to coding, understanding user needs, and embracing design principles, I can create software that meets both functional and non-functional requirements!
